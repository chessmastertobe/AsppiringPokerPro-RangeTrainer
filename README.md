# Range Trainer

Range Trainer is a training software designed for poker players to help them master the pre-flop element of poker. New and intermediate players alike are often confronted with complex systems of poker opening ranges that can sometimes take a long time to memorize. The goal of this project was to design a streamlined and efficient system for allowing poker players to master their opening ranges.
